## Declarative vs Imperative Examples

### Imperative Example (Avoid)

```gherkin
Scenario: User logs in
  Given I am on the login page
  When I type "user@example.com" in the email field
    And I type "password123" in the password field
    And I press the "Submit" button
  Then I see "Welcome" on the home page
```

### Declarative Example (Preferred)

```gherkin
Scenario: User logs in successfully
  Given Alice has a valid account
  When Alice logs in with valid credentials
  Then Alice sees her personalized dashboard
```

## UI-Specific vs Behavior-Focused Examples

### UI-Specific (Avoid)

```gherkin
Scenario: User filters products
  Given the user is on the products page
  When the user clicks the price dropdown
    And selects "$50-$100" from the dropdown menu
    And clicks the "Apply Filter" button
  Then the product grid refreshes
    And displays products in that price range
```

### Behavior-Focused (Preferred)

```gherkin
Scenario: User filters products by price
  Given the product catalog contains items in various price ranges
  When the user applies a price filter of $50-$100
  Then only products priced between $50 and $100 are shown
```

---

## Focused vs Multiple Behaviors Examples

### Multiple Behaviors (Avoid)

```gherkin
Scenario: Coupon application
  Given a user has coupons
  When the user applies a valid coupon
  Then the discount is applied
  When the user applies an expired coupon
  Then an error is shown
  # This tests two different behaviors!
```

### Focused Scenarios (Preferred)

```gherkin
Scenario: User with valid coupon receives discount
  Given a user has a valid 10% off coupon
  When the user applies the coupon at checkout
  Then the order total is reduced by 10%

Scenario: User with expired coupon sees error
  Given a user has an expired coupon
  When the user applies the coupon at checkout
  Then an error message states "Coupon has expired"
```

## Meaningful vs Generic Data Examples

### Generic Data (Avoid)

```gherkin
Given product1 costs $25.99
  And product2 costs $5.99
When the user adds items
Then total is correct
```

### Meaningful Data (Preferred)

```gherkin
Given a product "Wireless Mouse" priced at $25.99
  And a product "USB Cable" priced at $5.99
When the user adds both products to the cart
Then the cart total is $31.98
```
